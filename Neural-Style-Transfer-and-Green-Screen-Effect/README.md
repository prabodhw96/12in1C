# Neural-Style-Transfer-and-Green-Screen-Effect
## Overview
This project involves neural style transfer on images and videos and green screen effect on images. Before running notebooks, create a folder named "models" to store and download ``.t7`` files.

To apply neural video transfer in real-time using webcam, set ``cv2.VideoCapture(0)`` in ``Neural Style Transfer on Video.ipynb``.

Links for downloading style transfer models can be found in ``download_style_transfer_models.txt``.
