# RNN-Addition
## Overview
This project employs Keras with Tensorflow as its backend to create a recurrent neural network model and train it to perform addition of simple equations given in string format. This involves creating synthetic data, and training and evaluating sequence to sequence RNN model in Keras. Here,  the model needs to understand the meaning of various characters from a sequence of text input and then learn addition from the data.
