# K-Means-Image-Compression
## Overview
This project uses computationally time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm, Mini-Batch K-Means, to compress high-resolution images, and leverage the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider. You can check the original and compressed images in corresponding folders.
