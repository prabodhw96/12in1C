# Keras-Custom-Layers
## Overview
**Objective:** To create a custom layer in Keras, and create a model using the custom layer.<br><br>
**Steps:**
1. Create a simplified version of a Parametric ReLU layer, and use it in a neural network model.
2. Use the neural network to solve a multi-class classi?cation problem. 
3. Compare the activation layer with the more commonly used ReLU activation layer.
